# Evaluating the Global Demand and Supply for Inclusive Innovation

## About

MaRS will be a regional host for the 2019 MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge, run by MIT's Initiative on the Digital Economy. The challenge brings together companies from around the world that are innovating in four categories - Skills Development & Opportunity Matching, Income Growth & Job Creation, Technology Access, and Financial Inclusion. The final round of the challenge is held in Boston in November, where the winning companies are awarded prize money and are set up to receive business support.

Our research team at MaRS is investigating the global Demand and Supply of services that address each one of the four challenge issues. We are interested in identifying the priority needs in different countries, and where there are gaps in meeting those needs.
